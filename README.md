# Data preprocessing
Pathway enrichment scores for categorical data (i.e., mutation, copy number variation, and drug targets) were obtained by the NetPEA algorithm, which is available at: https://github.com/TangYiChing/NetPEA, while pathway enrichment scores for numeric data (i.e., gene expression) was obtained by the gseapy tool (https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/gseapy_example.html).
